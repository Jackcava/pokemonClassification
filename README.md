# pokemonClassification
A simple pipeline for classifying pokemon.

The ML procedure followed in this repository aims to extract color-based discriminative features from pokemon images to build a model that predicts the type (fire, water or grass) of a pokemon in a supervised manner.

10 different classifiers have been tested and each for each of which different parameters have been studied and the maximum accuracy achieved is about 80% with the Random Forest.
